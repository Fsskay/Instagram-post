When I look back on all those moments, I realize how those conversations kept us all closer and our communication better.  So when Johnrick and I moved into our new home, it‚Äôs no surprise that our dining table from @castleryus was our very first furniture. We would always sleep on the floor but we made sure that every meal was shared on our table. It became our spot to share how our day at work went, while eating dinner. On our days off, it‚Äôs where we would eat breakfast or brunch while planning our next home project or which home goods store we‚Äôre going to next. You can probably say it‚Äôs one of the most important parts of the house for me. That‚Äôs why I picked a dining table that will last us forever! For the longest time I was torn between a wooden table or a marble one. But I‚Äôm pretty clumsy so I needed one that won‚Äôt easily show signs of wear and tear.

I had for a long time wanted to upgrade our bed and mattress (it was about seven years old), Nathan was having some back issues so we dove headfirst into researching mattresses and also spoke to a few friends of ours who had upgraded their beds due to similar reasons ‚Ä¢ The verdict was to get a memory foam mattress, we went with @ecosa_sleep because I really liked their pricing, returns policy and also the fact that you could reconfigure the three layers inside the mattress to adjust the firmness of the mattress over time or according to our needs ‚Ä¢ The first night was interesting, it was so strange going from a spring mattress to a foam mattress, but after a few nights, we were well and truly use to it. ‚Ä¢ We have been now sleeping on the Ecosa mattress for about two months and LOVE it!! Nathan doesn't wake up anymore with back pain and my back is feeling so much better! The mattress arrived as a medium/firm configuration and we haven't felt the need to change it ‚Ä¢ If you are in need of a new mattress I would highly recommend @ecosa_sleep , their customer service was second to none, delivery time was super quick and the quality and comfort of the mattress is incredible!!! ‚Ä¢ Our bed frame is from @castleryau (the link for the exact frame is below). ‚Ä¢ They have kindly offered our readers 10% off full priced items when you use the code FAWNANDFINCH from the 14th to the 28th of November.

Some meals were longer than others because we would just keep chatting ‚Äî the things that happened during our younger years, the ghosts and evil spirit stories, what happened in school, and just so many random things. When I look back on all those moments, I realize how those conversations kept us all closer and our communication better.  So when Johnrick and I moved into our new home, it‚Äôs no surprise that our dining table from @castleryus was our very first furniture. We would always sleep on the floor but we made sure that every meal was shared on our table. It became our spot to share how our day at work went, while eating dinner. On our days off, it‚Äôs where we would eat breakfast or brunch while planning our next home project or which home goods store we‚Äôre going to next. You can probably say it‚Äôs one of the most important parts of the house for me. That‚Äôs why I picked a dining table that will last us forever! For the longest time I was torn between a wooden table or a marble one. But I‚Äôm pretty clumsy so I needed one that won‚Äôt easily show signs of wear and tear. So happy we went with the Chelsea Marble table!  Swipe for some of our meals as well as before and after photos!
