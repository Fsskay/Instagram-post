Structural changes were made to the backyard by removing the spiral stairs and extending more floor space. Next, we linked a pop of pattern graphic tile connecting the outdoor kitchen to the side of the home to make the backyard more spacious. By sticking with a cement structure and stainless steel backslash, the outdoor kitchen set up was designed to last through rain or shine.
