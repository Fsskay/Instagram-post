Structural changes were made to the backyard by removing the spiral stairs and extending more floor space. Next, we linked a pop of pattern graphic tile connecting the outdoor kitchen to the side of the home to make the backyard more spacious. By sticking with a cement structure and stainless steel backslash, the outdoor kitchen set up was designed to last through rain or shine.

I had for a long time wanted to upgrade our bed and mattress (it was about seven years old), Nathan was having some back issues so we dove headfirst into researching mattresses and also spoke to a few friends of ours who had upgraded their beds due to similar reasons • The verdict was to get a memory foam mattress, we went with @ecosa_sleep because I really liked their pricing, returns policy and also the fact that you could reconfigure the three layers inside the mattress to adjust the firmness of the mattress over time or according to our needs • The first night was interesting, it was so strange going from a spring mattress to a foam mattress, but after a few nights, we were well and truly use to it. • We have been now sleeping on the Ecosa mattress for about two months and LOVE it!! Nathan doesn't wake up anymore with back pain and my back is feeling so much better! The mattress arrived as a medium/firm configuration and we haven't felt the need to change it • If you are in need of a new mattress I would highly recommend @ecosa_sleep , their customer service was second to none, delivery time was super quick and the quality and comfort of the mattress is incredible!!! • Our bed frame is from @castleryau (the link for the exact frame is below). • They have kindly offered our readers 10% off full priced items when you use the code FAWNANDFINCH from the 14th to the 28th of November. I have been so impressed with this bed frame it was so easy to put together and their customer service and delivery times were second to none!!! • #fawnandfinch",

Besides a comfortable mattress, having a good bed frame definitely adds a lot to comfort (and of course the aesthetics). So glad we went ahead with the Joseph King Bed Frame from @castlerysg. It’s such a classic and timeless looking piece, and is such a commanding piece for a simple bedroom like ours. I also prefer having loose furniture as opposed to built-ins because the space can then evolve with me as my needs changes.  That aside, Castlery has a wide variety of beautiful pieces (we also got our work desks from them) that is sure to fit great in your home! For National day, until 10 August, get $55 off every $800 spent! It’s a great deal you guys won’t wanna miss out!",

      "content": "I grew up with my aunt’s big family and every meal time, me and my cousins would gather around the table, eat (or sometimes fight for more food 😅), and talk about so many things. Some meals were longer than others because we would just keep chatting — the things that happened during our younger years, the ghosts and evil spirit stories, what happened in school, and just so many random things. When I look back on all those moments, I realize how those conversations kept us all closer and our communication better.  So when Johnrick and I moved into our new home, it’s no surprise that our dining table from @castleryus was our very first furniture. We would always sleep on the floor but we made sure that every meal was shared on our table. It became our spot to share how our day at work went, while eating dinner. On our days off, it’s where we would eat breakfast or brunch while planning our next home project or which home goods store we’re going to next. You can probably say it’s one of the most important parts of the house for me. That’s why I picked a dining table that will last us forever! For the longest time I was torn between a wooden table or a marble one. But I’m pretty clumsy so I needed one that won’t easily show signs of wear and tear. So happy we went with the Chelsea Marble table!  Swipe for some of our meals as well as before and after photos! Also, check out my stories for a quick video on how we styled the dining area as well as the link to our dining table and other products. #castleryus",

If you could have any 3 people over for dinner, dead or alive, real or fiction, who would it be? ❤️💙❤️ This answer changes for me depending on my life situation and emotional state at the time 😂 But right now, I don’t care who it is, I’m just happy we can eat at a dining table and not on the couche... which we’ve been doing for 3 months 🤦🏻‍♀️ But seriously, I love this table - a marble top, timber legs and brass accents, well worth waiting to find the right one! 🙌🏼 Well done @castleryau 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 NOW, who are your 3 guests?",

It's a faux fire and plugs into the wall since it's electric. We have ducted cooling and heating so we don't use it as a heat source and therefore can't comment on its consumption. You can just turn on the light for ambience or you can have it on a heat setting which compares to a hairdryer. They're about $600 from modaliving and I'm pretty sure that was including delivery. Hope that answers all your questions. Drop some below if I've missed something so I can refer people to this thread when they ask ❤😚",
